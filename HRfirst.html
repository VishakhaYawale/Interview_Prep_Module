                <h4><b>1. Tell me about yourself.</b></h4><br>
                <p>This is the universal question asked at the very first of any interview. It sounds easy, right? But this is the most important question where the candidates fail
                    to create an impression with the interviewer as most of the time they are not aware of what exactly needs to be said.</p><br>
                    <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not ask the interviewer what he wants to know about you. You may be asking genuinely, but that just sounds rude.</li> 
                        <li> Do not speak what is already there in the resume. The interviewer wants to know what they have not seen on the resume.And do not speak about anything personal.</li>
                        <li> Introduce yourself by including certain adjectives like problem-solving, innovation and tech-savvy, creative, quick learner, etc. that best describe you in your professional life to boost your chances.</li>
                        <li>Cover what you have accomplished in your career and what work you have done in the past which can help you excel in the position that you are being interviewed for.</li>
                        <li>You can also tell why you want the position and how the job is going to be perfect for you.</li>
                        <li> Focus only on your strengths that are relatable to the work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                    <p>I am an energetic person, an effective communicator, and a quick learner. I was also one of the top students in my batch while I was pursuing a B.E degree in the XYZ domain.
                        I worked on various projects related to the software domain which provided me a great deal of technical exposure along with the importance of working in a team and the value 
                        of client satisfaction. I have worked on developing various enterprise-level web applications for helping companies solve problems like ensuring business continuity, market research
                        analysis, etc. So, I believe I am a good fit for technology-centric roles in your company.</p><br>
