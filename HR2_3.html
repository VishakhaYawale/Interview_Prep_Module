                <h4><b>13. Tell me about a time when you were made to work under close supervision.</b></h4><br>
                <p>Here, the interviewer evaluates how well you work in a team and how well you can work independently.</p><br>
                   <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                   <p>In my previous job, I was working under the close supervision of my manager. It felt very overwhelming 
                       as the manager watched everything that I do throughout the day and I felt like he/she was virtually sitting 
                       by me at all times. I was uncomfortable with this because of the constant pressure involved. But then, I 
                       found out that the manager did not trust me enough to do my job alone as I was very new to it. So I worked on
                        building her trust by working very diligently without any complaints in the projects and once I felt the manager
                         was convinced of my abilities, I discussed with her to hand me a project which didn’t involve such close supervision.
                          The manager gave me one such project reluctantly and I made sure I gave my best to it and the project was launched 
                          successfully which is how I gained her complete trust.</p>
