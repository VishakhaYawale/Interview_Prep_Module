                <h4><b>7. What is your biggest achievement so far?</b></h4><br>
                <p>Make sure to discuss only your work-related achievement. Pick up the most recent achievement of yours and answer this question.</p><br>
                    <b>Tips to answer this:</b><br>
                    Answer the question in a STAR format. STAR represents: S: Situation, T: Task, A: Action, and R: Result<br>
                    <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                    <p>I have achieved several milestones to date in my career as a software developer. The most recent one is of the time when we were 
                        working on a critical component of a product pertaining to customer payments. We were working round the clock for around 2 months 
                        and I was a core developer. I was made a lead to this component for completing the task in another 2 months.

                        To meet the deadline, we ensured that we upskilled ourselves to learn all the aspects of the development of this module and also 
                        brought in a few more resources to complete it faster. Post the deployment, I trained our team to support the platform proficiently.
                        Ultimately, we could complete the product well in advance of the deadline. When the product was launched,
                        the higher management was super proud of us and our team was awarded for our outstanding performance in the quarterly town hall.
                        It was a very proud moment for me</p>
