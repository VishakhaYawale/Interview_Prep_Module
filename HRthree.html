                <h4><b>3. What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?</b></h4><br>
                <p>HR asks this question to get to know more about your characteristics and your suitability for the job. It is also one of the
                     standards and most commonly asked questions.</p><br>
                    <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be honest.</li>
                        <li>Start by stating the strongest skills and qualities that can be of a great match to the job role.</li>
                        <li>Be ready with the backup claim for each of the strengths that you mention. Hence, avoid speaking of the strengths that you do not possess.</li>
                        <li> Do not tell any weakness that can potentially jeopardize your candidature.</li>
                        <li> Do not mention more than 2 weaknesses and always mention how you are working on improving them.</li>
                        <li>Do not tell cheesy, cliché answers like “I am a perfectionist which is both my strength and my weakness”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                    <p>I think one of my greatest strengths is that I am a great team player. I am also a self-motivated and quick learning individual. 
                        Whatever task that I set to do, I always give my best and complete it diligently well in advance. My weakness would be that I am 
                        learning to master people skills while meeting new individuals. I get nervous while talking to new people. I have been working on
                         this for quite a long time and I can say with utmost confidence that I have come a long way.</p>
