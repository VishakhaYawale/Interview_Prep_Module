                <h3><b>Traditional HR Questions</b></h3><br>
                <h4><b>1. Tell me about yourself.</b></h4><br>
                <p>This is the universal question asked at the very first of any interview. It sounds easy, right? But this is the most important question where the candidates fail
                    to create an impression with the interviewer as most of the time they are not aware of what exactly needs to be said.</p><br>
                    <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not ask the interviewer what he wants to know about you. You may be asking genuinely, but that just sounds rude.</li> 
                        <li> Do not speak what is already there in the resume. The interviewer wants to know what they have not seen on the resume.And do not speak about anything personal.</li>
                        <li> Introduce yourself by including certain adjectives like problem-solving, innovation and tech-savvy, creative, quick learner, etc. that best describe you in your professional life to boost your chances.</li>
                        <li>Cover what you have accomplished in your career and what work you have done in the past which can help you excel in the position that you are being interviewed for.</li>
                        <li>You can also tell why you want the position and how the job is going to be perfect for you.</li>
                        <li> Focus only on your strengths that are relatable to the work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                    <p>I am an energetic person, an effective communicator, and a quick learner. I was also one of the top students in my batch while I was pursuing a B.E degree in the XYZ domain.
                        I worked on various projects related to the software domain which provided me a great deal of technical exposure along with the importance of working in a team and the value 
                        of client satisfaction. I have worked on developing various enterprise-level web applications for helping companies solve problems like ensuring business continuity, market research
                        analysis, etc. So, I believe I am a good fit for technology-centric roles in your company.</p><br>
                    

                    <h4><b>2. Why do you want to work for our company?</b></h4><br>
                    <p>Another popular question asked by the interviewer to make sure that the candidate has understood the job requirements and help the interviewer understand the reason behind choosing their company for that job.
                        You should answer in such a way that the interviewer gets convinced that you are a great fit for the role</p><br>
                        <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talk about the past projects that you had worked on that matches the requirements of the current role.</li>
                            <li>Talk about your career aspirations that are associated with this job role.</li>
                            <li>Have the knowledge in hand about the company’s vision, mission, and the work it has done in recent years that inspired you to join the organization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                        <p>I feel that with my current skill sets and my experience in the XYZ domain, the job requirements this role presented are a perfect match for me. I could visualize myself
                            in that role as it aligned with my career aspirations, skills, and expertise. Besides, I have researched your company and found that it has impressive and promising projections
                            which made me excited to be a part of the amazing future. I would take pride in working under the great leadership of this company and I found this place to be a perfect fit for
                            utilizing my expertise along with the promising aspect of personal growth.</p><br>
                    

                        <h4><b>3. What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?</b></h4><br>
                        <p>HR asks this question to get to know more about your characteristics and your suitability for the job. It is also one of the
                                standards and most commonly asked questions.</p><br>
                            <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be honest.</li>
                                <li>Start by stating the strongest skills and qualities that can be of a great match to the job role.</li>
                                <li>Be ready with the backup claim for each of the strengths that you mention. Hence, avoid speaking of the strengths that you do not possess.</li>
                                <li> Do not tell any weakness that can potentially jeopardize your candidature.</li>
                                <li> Do not mention more than 2 weaknesses and always mention how you are working on improving them.</li>
                                <li>Do not tell cheesy, cliché answers like “I am a perfectionist which is both my strength and my weakness”.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                            <p>I think one of my greatest strengths is that I am a great team player. I am also a self-motivated and quick learning individual. 
                                Whatever task that I set to do, I always give my best and complete it diligently well in advance. My weakness would be that I am 
                                learning to master people skills while meeting new individuals. I get nervous while talking to new people. I have been working on
                                    this for quite a long time and I can say with utmost confidence that I have come a long way.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>4. Why are you looking for a change?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Yet another commonly asked question for experienced candidates, the interviewer wants to understand what made you look for
                                    different opportunities and identify if there are any red flags. Whatever is the reason for changing your job, do not talk
                                    negatively about the current employer. Do not divulge information about how bad the work environment was, how poor the 
                                    salary was as these are of no concern to the interviewer. Keep the answer professional without sharing your woes.
                                </p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer</b><br>
                                <p>The reason I am looking for change is that I feel like now is the time to expand my horizon. I have worked in my current company for quite a long time and while I am grateful for all the opportunities that
                                        were presented to me there, I want to go beyond my current role here, explore different avenues and take up challenging roles and I believe that your company will be the perfect place for me to push and 
                                        grow myself as an individual.</p><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>It happened due to an unforeseen event and it was not your fault.</li>
                                            <li>You still have a positive mindset about various opportunities that are available in the market.</li>
                                       </ul>
                                <b>Sample answer can be:</b><br>
                                <p>The client that I was working for was leaving the market and hence our company was forced to dissolve the department. Unfortunately, I had joined that position in that department very recently and hence
                                        my duration in this company was short. I do not have any regrets though as I was extremely happy due to the learning opportunities presented which will help me a lot in my further career endeavors.</p><br>
                                
                            <h4><b>5. Tell me about the gap in your resume.</b></h4><br>
                            <p>This question comes up when the interviewer finds something interesting and out of ordinary in the resume. Some examples could be a job that could be unrelated to what you are seeking or a job that lasted 
                                only for some months or in some cases, the outright gap between two consequent jobs. Here, HR wants to make sure that the gaps are not due to any red flags.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer :</b><br>
                                <p>After the completion of my bachelor’s degree, I started working continuously for 8 years without taking any break. This sort of impacted my productivity and also harmed my work-life balance. Hence, I decided
                                        to take a break of 6 months to clear my mind, make amends with my family, and also do solo travel to different places. I also gained some lessons during this break such as the importance of work-life balance, 
                                        organizational ability, and a fresh new perspective on life.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>6. How would you rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>The main point while answering this question is to not convey that you are perfect. This would indicate that there is no scope for improvement and would showcase yourself as overconfident to the interviewer.
                                Also, remember to not undervalue yourself too. This would show that you don’t have any self-confidence.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>I would like to rate myself an 8. 8 because I know that I am not perfect and there is always a scope for learning and improvement. Continuous learning is the most fundamental part of
                                        personal and professional growth.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>7. What is your biggest achievement so far?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Make sure to discuss only your work-related achievement. Pick up the most recent achievement of yours and answer this question.</p><br>
                                <b>Tips to answer this:</b><br>
                                Answer the question in a STAR format. STAR represents: S: Situation, T: Task, A: Action, and R: Result<br>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>I have achieved several milestones to date in my career as a software developer. The most recent one is of the time when we were 
                                    working on a critical component of a product pertaining to customer payments. We were working round the clock for around 2 months 
                                    and I was a core developer. I was made a lead to this component for completing the task in another 2 months.
            
                                    To meet the deadline, we ensured that we upskilled ourselves to learn all the aspects of the development of this module and also 
                                    brought in a few more resources to complete it faster. Post the deployment, I trained our team to support the platform proficiently.
                                    Ultimately, we could complete the product well in advance of the deadline. When the product was launched,
                                    the higher management was super proud of us and our team was awarded for our outstanding performance in the quarterly town hall.
                                    It was a very proud moment for me</p><br>

                            <h4><b>8. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Now, this question is the trickiest and deadliest one among all. This can prove to be a trap and you might not even be aware of it. While the question might seem casual, the main purpose of this question is 
                                to find out how long you are planning to stay in the company if hired and how your vision fits the vision of the company.</p><br>
                        
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You might be tempted to answer honestly by saying things about your plans for higher studies, your plans to start a startup, your plans of becoming a hiring manager in the company or if you don’t have a plan 
                                    then you are simply tempted to say you don’t have a plan at all. These are the things the interviewer doesn’t want to hear and hence avoid giving such answers.</li>

                            <h4><b>10. How do you deal with criticism?</b></h4><br>

                                <b>Sample answer :</b><br>
                                <p>I am always enthusiastic about learning new things and during the process, I might tend to make mistakes. If someone provides me with constructive criticism, I am always open to it and I will work on correcting 
                                    myself and learn from my mistakes. This would help me grow and move forward. If the feedback is negative, then I am mature enough to ignore the feedback and continue working on doing my job to the best of my
                                        capabilities without dampening my spirit.</p><br>
