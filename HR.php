            To hire suitable candidates, every company conducts various rounds of interviews
            to measure the candidates technical and behavioral prowess. HR interviews are done 
            to gauge the personality- strengths and weaknesses of a candidate to handle the role 
            and then understand whether the candidate is suitable to do the job. Sometimes, the 
            interviews are conducted to decide how well the candidate can fit into the companys work
            culture. Generally, these rounds are done at the end of the recruitment process after the 
            technical skills evaluation.

                <div class="points">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HR interview rounds can make or break your opportunity to join your dream company. Hence it is best to keep
                some tips in mind to ace this interview.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not fake! Be yourself. Bluffing during the HR interview should be avoided at all costs.</li>
                    <li>Answer to the point and while answering, be honest and truthful.</li>
                    <li> Wear comfortable but formal clothes. Keep accessories to a bare minimum.</li>
                    <li>Reach the venue on time. If the interview is scheduled online, then log in at 
                    least 10-15 minutes earlier than the scheduled time and ensure that your connection set up is alright.</li>
                    <li>Do not sound dull while answering. Be enthusiastic and interactive with the hiring managers. In case the 
                    interview is online, then remember to keep your video on. Lastly, have a smile on your face.</li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, let us see what are the most commonly asked HR interview questions and understand 
                    why the questions are being asked and what would be the sample acceptable answers to those questions.</li>
               </ul>
                
                <h4><b>1. Tell me about yourself.</b></h4><br>
                <p>This is the universal question asked at the very first of any interview. It sounds easy, right? But this is the most important question where the candidates fail
                    to create an impression with the interviewer as most of the time they are not aware of what exactly needs to be said.</p><br>
                    <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not ask the interviewer what he wants to know about you. You may be asking genuinely, but that just sounds rude.</li> 
                        <li> Do not speak what is already there in the resume. The interviewer wants to know what they have not seen on the resume.And do not speak about anything personal.</li>
                        <li> Introduce yourself by including certain adjectives like problem-solving, innovation and tech-savvy, creative, quick learner, etc. that best describe you in your professional life to boost your chances.</li>
                        <li>Cover what you have accomplished in your career and what work you have done in the past which can help you excel in the position that you are being interviewed for.</li>
                        <li>You can also tell why you want the position and how the job is going to be perfect for you.</li>
                        <li> Focus only on your strengths that are relatable to the work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                    <p>I am an energetic person, an effective communicator, and a quick learner. I was also one of the top students in my batch while I was pursuing a B.E degree in the XYZ domain.
                        I worked on various projects related to the software domain which provided me a great deal of technical exposure along with the importance of working in a team and the value 
                        of client satisfaction. I have worked on developing various enterprise-level web applications for helping companies solve problems like ensuring business continuity, market research
                        analysis, etc. So, I believe I am a good fit for technology-centric roles in your company.</p><br>
                    

                    <h4><b>2. Why do you want to work for our company?</b></h4><br>
                    <p>Another popular question asked by the interviewer to make sure that the candidate has understood the job requirements and help the interviewer understand the reason behind choosing their company for that job.
                        You should answer in such a way that the interviewer gets convinced that you are a great fit for the role</p><br>
                        <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talk about the past projects that you had worked on that matches the requirements of the current role.</li>
                            <li>Talk about your career aspirations that are associated with this job role.</li>
                            <li>Have the knowledge in hand about the company’s vision, mission, and the work it has done in recent years that inspired you to join the organization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                        <p>I feel that with my current skill sets and my experience in the XYZ domain, the job requirements this role presented are a perfect match for me. I could visualize myself
                            in that role as it aligned with my career aspirations, skills, and expertise. Besides, I have researched your company and found that it has impressive and promising projections
                            which made me excited to be a part of the amazing future. I would take pride in working under the great leadership of this company and I found this place to be a perfect fit for
                            utilizing my expertise along with the promising aspect of personal growth.</p><br>
                    

                        <h4><b>3. What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?</b></h4><br>
                        <p>HR asks this question to get to know more about your characteristics and your suitability for the job. It is also one of the
                                standards and most commonly asked questions.</p><br>
                            <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be honest.</li>
                                <li>Start by stating the strongest skills and qualities that can be of a great match to the job role.</li>
                                <li>Be ready with the backup claim for each of the strengths that you mention. Hence, avoid speaking of the strengths that you do not possess.</li>
                                <li> Do not tell any weakness that can potentially jeopardize your candidature.</li>
                                <li> Do not mention more than 2 weaknesses and always mention how you are working on improving them.</li>
                                <li>Do not tell cheesy, cliché answers like “I am a perfectionist which is both my strength and my weakness”.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <b>Sample answer could be:</b><br>
                            <p>I think one of my greatest strengths is that I am a great team player. I am also a self-motivated and quick learning individual. 
                                Whatever task that I set to do, I always give my best and complete it diligently well in advance. My weakness would be that I am 
                                learning to master people skills while meeting new individuals. I get nervous while talking to new people. I have been working on
                                    this for quite a long time and I can say with utmost confidence that I have come a long way.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>4. Why are you looking for a change?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Yet another commonly asked question for experienced candidates, the interviewer wants to understand what made you look for
                                    different opportunities and identify if there are any red flags. Whatever is the reason for changing your job, do not talk
                                    negatively about the current employer. Do not divulge information about how bad the work environment was, how poor the 
                                    salary was as these are of no concern to the interviewer. Keep the answer professional without sharing your woes.
                                </p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer</b><br>
                                <p>The reason I am looking for change is that I feel like now is the time to expand my horizon. I have worked in my current company for quite a long time and while I am grateful for all the opportunities that
                                        were presented to me there, I want to go beyond my current role here, explore different avenues and take up challenging roles and I believe that your company will be the perfect place for me to push and 
                                        grow myself as an individual.</p><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>It happened due to an unforeseen event and it was not your fault.</li>
                                            <li>You still have a positive mindset about various opportunities that are available in the market.</li>
                                       </ul>
                                <b>Sample answer can be:</b><br>
                                <p>The client that I was working for was leaving the market and hence our company was forced to dissolve the department. Unfortunately, I had joined that position in that department very recently and hence
                                        my duration in this company was short. I do not have any regrets though as I was extremely happy due to the learning opportunities presented which will help me a lot in my further career endeavors.</p><br>
                                
                            <h4><b>5. Tell me about the gap in your resume.</b></h4><br>
                            <p>This question comes up when the interviewer finds something interesting and out of ordinary in the resume. Some examples could be a job that could be unrelated to what you are seeking or a job that lasted 
                                only for some months or in some cases, the outright gap between two consequent jobs. Here, HR wants to make sure that the gaps are not due to any red flags.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer :</b><br>
                                <p>After the completion of my bachelor’s degree, I started working continuously for 8 years without taking any break. This sort of impacted my productivity and also harmed my work-life balance. Hence, I decided
                                        to take a break of 6 months to clear my mind, make amends with my family, and also do solo travel to different places. I also gained some lessons during this break such as the importance of work-life balance, 
                                        organizational ability, and a fresh new perspective on life.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>6. How would you rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>The main point while answering this question is to not convey that you are perfect. This would indicate that there is no scope for improvement and would showcase yourself as overconfident to the interviewer.
                                Also, remember to not undervalue yourself too. This would show that you don’t have any self-confidence.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>I would like to rate myself an 8. 8 because I know that I am not perfect and there is always a scope for learning and improvement. Continuous learning is the most fundamental part of
                                        personal and professional growth.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>7. What is your biggest achievement so far?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Make sure to discuss only your work-related achievement. Pick up the most recent achievement of yours and answer this question.</p><br>
                                <b>Tips to answer this:</b><br>
                                Answer the question in a STAR format. STAR represents: S: Situation, T: Task, A: Action, and R: Result<br>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>I have achieved several milestones to date in my career as a software developer. The most recent one is of the time when we were 
                                    working on a critical component of a product pertaining to customer payments. We were working round the clock for around 2 months 
                                    and I was a core developer. I was made a lead to this component for completing the task in another 2 months.
            
                                    To meet the deadline, we ensured that we upskilled ourselves to learn all the aspects of the development of this module and also 
                                    brought in a few more resources to complete it faster. Post the deployment, I trained our team to support the platform proficiently.
                                    Ultimately, we could complete the product well in advance of the deadline. When the product was launched,
                                    the higher management was super proud of us and our team was awarded for our outstanding performance in the quarterly town hall.
                                    It was a very proud moment for me</p><br>

                            <h4><b>8. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Now, this question is the trickiest and deadliest one among all. This can prove to be a trap and you might not even be aware of it. While the question might seem casual, the main purpose of this question is 
                                to find out how long you are planning to stay in the company if hired and how your vision fits the vision of the company.</p><br>
                        
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You might be tempted to answer honestly by saying things about your plans for higher studies, your plans to start a startup, your plans of becoming a hiring manager in the company or if you don’t have a plan 
                                    then you are simply tempted to say you don’t have a plan at all. These are the things the interviewer doesn’t want to hear and hence avoid giving such answers.</li>
                                    <li>The recruiter is only interested in knowing how long you are planning to stay in the company and how satisfied you are with the current position you are going to be hired.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>Over 5 years, I would love to utilize all the opportunities that this company provides me to learn by utilizing the internal and external training programs. My ultimate career goal is to become a Technology
                                        Architect and hence I would look forward to developing various products that represent the vision of this company and be a part of making a difference along with quickening my journey of becoming a Tech Architect.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>9. Why should we hire you?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>The recruiter asks this important question to understand how well you would fit into the position because every hire is a risk to the interviewer in case they turn out to be unfit.
                                    Your answer to this question can make or break your interview. Hence, prepare well for this question and make sure to convey to the interviewer why you are the perfect fit for the position.</p><br>
                                <b>Some tips to answer would be to include:</b><br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How well you would perform the job and how you would be a great addition to the team.</li>
                                    <li>How you possess the right talent which makes you stand apart.</li>
                                    <li>Everything should boil down to how you can add great value to the organization.</li>
                               </ul>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>I am a self-motivated and very open-minded person who can learn very fast. Looking at the job description and my experience in the field of web development, I am confident that I am very much suitable
                                        for this role. I enjoy solving problems and I am a great team player. I also believe that my values are aligned with this company’s values. I think this position will support my interest and also give
                                        me interesting and exciting opportunities to contribute to the growth of this organization. I am very much excited about this opportunity.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>10. How do you deal with criticism?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>The main intention to ask this question is to see what your attitude towards feedback is and how you react to it. The main point here is to let the interviewer know that you are always open to constructive feedback.
                                    You should not show yourself as a stubborn or ignorant person who is not capable of taking any input for your growth.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer :</b><br>
                                <p>I am always enthusiastic about learning new things and during the process, I might tend to make mistakes. If someone provides me with constructive criticism, I am always open to it and I will work on correcting 
                                    myself and learn from my mistakes. This would help me grow and move forward. If the feedback is negative, then I am mature enough to ignore the feedback and continue working on doing my job to the best of my
                                        capabilities without dampening my spirit.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>11. What Are These Behavioural Questions</b></h4><br>
                            <p>These questions are mostly of the format “Tell me about a time…” where you would be asked to share your experience based on certain scenarios which would help the interviewer judge how well you handled various work situations thereby reflecting your skills, capacity, and personality.
            
                                Always answer such types of questions using the STAR format to provide structured answers. STAR has the following questions to be answered in the same order:</p><br>
                                <b>1. Situation:</b>What was the situation/event?<br>
                                <b>2. Task:</b> What were the tasks involved in the above-mentioned situation?<br>
                                <b>3. Result: </b> What was the result of the actions? This is the most important part which conveys if you were successful or not.
                                Avoid bragging and exaggerating at all costs.<br>

                            <h4><b>12. Tell me about a time when you were not satisfied with your performance?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Here, the interviewer gets to know the extent of ownership you take while performing any task. It also reflects how well you care about the job and the company.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>When I initially joined my job right after college, there was a point where I was constantly becoming dependent on the team members to get work done. I did not like
                                    this as I wanted to carry out my responsibilities in an independent manner along with working in a team. I wasted no time and quickly learned the working dynamics
                                        of the project and received various assignments related to the project. The more assignments I worked on with minimal help, the more confident I became and the more 
                                        sense of ownership is provided. I felt more independent and I was lauded multiple times for my dedication, my sense of ownership, and how quickly I was able to adapt 
                                        to the project.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>13. Tell me about a time when you were made to work under close supervision.</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Here, the interviewer evaluates how well you work in a team and how well you can work independently.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>In my previous job, I was working under the close supervision of my manager. It felt very overwhelming 
                                    as the manager watched everything that I do throughout the day and I felt like he/she was virtually sitting 
                                    by me at all times. I was uncomfortable with this because of the constant pressure involved. But then, I 
                                    found out that the manager did not trust me enough to do my job alone as I was very new to it. So I worked on
                                    building her trust by working very diligently without any complaints in the projects and once I felt the manager
                                        was convinced of my abilities, I discussed with her to hand me a project which didn’t involve such close supervision.
                                        The manager gave me one such project reluctantly and I made sure I gave my best to it and the project was launched 
                                        successfully which is how I gained her complete trust.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>14. Can you tell me about a time where you were happy with your work and what was your reaction?</b></h4><br>
                            <p>By asking this question, the interviewer wants to understand what success means to you and what feeling it brings out 
                                in you. By this, they can assess your concerns for the growth of the company along with your personal growth.</p><br>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>There was a time in my previous company where I was handling a project related to blogging that would potentially
                                    inspire a lot of people. So I worked on researching what topics would people get inspiration from and what would 
                                    help them be better. I also conducted a survey which I shared with my friends, neighbors and relatives to get better 
                                    insights about this. When we published the blog, the recognition that we got was tremendous. People loved how relatable 
                                    the posts were and this turned out to be a significant reason behind the 90% sales of our products. I was very happy with
                                        my work as I did my part in contributing to company profits as well as providing a platform to people where they can get 
                                        inspiration from.</p><br>

                            <h4><b>15. Tell me about a time where you experienced difficulty at work while working on a project.</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Now, this is a broad question as difficulty can be of any type. This question is asked to assess what are the things that
                                    you consider as difficult and how you go about solving that difficulty. While answering this:</p><br>

                                        <li>Do not answer negatively or bad mouth any supervisor or any company.</li>
                                        <li>The interviewer should be made to understand the cause of the problem.</li>
                                        <li>Avoid bringing up personal problems in your life.</li>
                                        <li>Focus on the learnings of the problem rather than dwelling too much on the damage.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>There was a time in my current company when I received a bug report from our client which stated that the databases were performing below the mark when a complex query was called excessively from the interface.
            
                                The first thing I did was checking the logs to perform the root cause analysis. Doing this gave me a rough idea regarding where the bug started appearing. I reproduced the bug only on the production server and I tried replicating the same on my local system. While debugging, I found out that there was a bug in the Java code where some lines were commented out by the developers who had already left this company.
                                
                                I fixed this code quickly and did a round of performance testing on the application to ensure that this doesn’t occur again. The issue was fixed at the end of the day and we were able to get the server up and running with enhanced performance. We learnt an important lesson to perform regression testing after every phase of releases to ensure the old functionalities were working fine along with the newly developed ones</p>

                                <p>I remember this event. Every year, my company used to organize a summer barbeque, and this year, the person who was supposed to organize had left for a new job. I used to volunteer for this before so I volunteered myself for organizing the barbeque this year.
            
                                The annual barbeque was a potluck event with some fun activities planned throughout the day. I conducted a survey amongst the employees to see what kind of activities they were interested in. I made a list of those activities and created teams dedicated to conducting each of them. I also ensured that activities did not cross the budget allocated and took care of sending out regular reminders to track the progress of the team. I sent out posters and went through the office floors with a team of people to make sure people are aware of what exciting things we have planned for them and ensure that they arrive at the venue on time. The day of the event was an amazing one. As we had everything planned, the event went on smoothly and everyone had loads of fun.

                                are part and parcel of working in a team. Hence, the recruiter wants to know if you are capable of handling such disagreements

                                        would be the best thing to do and how it would make the lives of our users easier. I gave him various scenarios and good reasons why that feature 
                                        would be a great idea. My manager was convinced as he felt the reasons were good enough and we got his green signal to work on it. In the end,
                                        when we unveiled this feature to our client, the clients were indeed very happy and praised us all as we went out of our way to add this feature.
                                        My manager was very happy with the result. I learned that effective and graceful communication is the ultimate key. Ideas should be respectfully 
                                        conveyed to people when there are disagreements as we belong to a team and the collective vision of the team is to launch the project successfully. 
                                        In case my manager’s idea was best for the project, then I would gracefully accept that too.</p><br>

                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>I certainly understand that there might be valid reasons for a company to change the priority of a project.
                                        The vision of a project at one particular point of time would change at another time due to various conditions.
                                        If the priority of the task that I work on gets changed, I will put efforts into understanding why this happened
                                        and I will consider that it is in the best interest of the company and start to work on the new task of higher 
                                        priority rather than crib about it. The ultimate goal is to achieve big things by putting in my best efforts.</p><br>

                                        asking my colleagues how they have worked on dealing with him. If things get worse, I will contact HR to get a solution regarding this</p><br>

                            <p>The main intention of this question is to understand if you will fit into the work environment that the company has already. Employers want to ensure that 
                                the employees are more productive and happy doing their work and retain them in the long run and hence they ask this kind of question to understand if the

                                <p>According to me, an ideal work environment is one that revolves around a team where the focus is on learning, working, and growing together to take the

                                    your company, I found that you pay more importance to teamwork and that was something which impressed me. I believe that I can work better in an encouraging

                                    in my job. I love challenges as they push me to do more. I believe that learning should never end and the day
                                        we stop learning is the day we get stagnant and this thought always motivates me to learn something new.

                                <p>Whenever I am assigned multiple tasks, the first thing I do is to calm myself down and build up a positive mindset that I 
                                    can achieve the task. I then begin to organize them based on the priorities and come up with a plan to set deadlines for
                                        each of them and begin to work on the task. Whenever I feel like I am blocked or I am facing roadblocks, I let my supervisor
                                        know of this and I don’t hesitate to seek help from my colleagues. If I see that I am not able to meet the deadlines, then 
                                        I will be informing my manager well in advance by detailing whatever I have done. Most of the time, my manager was kind enough
                                        to understand the cause of delays and I would receive an extension in the deadline and I ensure that my tasks are completed.</p><br>

                                    Interviewers do not generally look for the correct answers. They would just want to see how well you are
                                    capable of analyzing a problem and what is your thought process to approach a problem.</p><br>
                                <b>Some tips to answer this question:</b><br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Take time to analyze the answer.</li>
                                    <li>Note down your thought process while answering.</li>
                                    <li>Show that you are actually in the process of solving a problem.</li>
                                    <li>Do not blurt out answers without thinking.</li>
                                    <li>Do not say I don’t know without even trying.</li>
                               </ul>
                                <b>Sample answer:</b><br>
                                <p>We know that we have 24 hours in a day. The hand first overlaps at 12:00,
                                        then at 1:05, 2:10, 3.15, 4:20, 5:25, 6:30, 7:35, 8:40, 9:45 and 10:50 two 
                                        times in a day. There will be no overlap at 11:55 because the hour hand is moving 
                                        towards 12 while the minute hand is at 11. This sums up the result to 22.</p><br>

                            <p>These kinds of questions are asked to find out if the interviewers can afford to hire you based on their budget and the range that they wish to offer. They want to ensure that your expectations and the range provided by the company are aligned and you are satisfied with it. It is very important to know and realize yourself worthwhile answering these questions especially when your expectations are more than what they are expecting to provide.
            
                                You do not want to come across as a money-minded person nor do you want to come across as a saint who is happy with being underpaid. Also, this is the part where your negotiation skills also come into play.</p><br>
